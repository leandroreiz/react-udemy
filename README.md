## Using JSX

Consider this variable declaration:

```javascript
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

This funny tag syntax is neither a string nor HTML.

It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.

JSX produces React “elements”. We will explore rendering them to the DOM in the next section. Below, you can find the basics of JSX necessary to get you started.

### Embedding Expressions in JSX

In the example below, we declare a variable called name and then use it inside JSX by wrapping it in curly braces:

```javascript
const name = 'Josh Perez';
const element = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;

ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

You can put any valid JavaScript expression inside the curly braces in JSX. For example, ```2 + 2```, ```user.firstName```, or ```formatName(user)``` are all valid JavaScript expressions.

In the example below, we embed the result of calling a JavaScript function, ```formatName(user)```, into an ```<h1>``` element.

```javascript
function formatName(user) {
  return user.firstName + ' ' + user.lastName;
}

const user = {
  firstName: 'Harper',
  lastName: 'Perez'
};

const element = (
  <h1>
    Hello, {formatName(user)}!
  </h1>
);

ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

### JSX is an Expression Too

After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects.

This means that you can use JSX inside of if statements and for loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return it from functions:

```javascript
function getGreeting(user) {
  if (user) {
    return <h1>Hello, {formatName(user)}!</h1>;
  }
  return <h1>Hello, Stranger.</h1>;
}
```

### JSX Represents Objects

Babel compiles JSX down to ```React.createElement()``` calls.

These two examples are identical:

```javascript
const element = (
  <h1 className="greeting">
    Hello, world!
  </h1>
);
const element = React.createElement(
  'h1',
  {className: 'greeting'},
  'Hello, world!'
);
```

```React.createElement()``` performs a few checks to help you write bug-free code but essentially it creates an object like this:

```javascript
// Note: this structure is simplified
const element = {
  type: 'h1',
  props: {
    className: 'greeting',
    children: 'Hello, world!'
  }
};
```

These objects are called “React elements”. You can think of them as descriptions of what you want to see on the screen. React reads these objects and uses them to construct the DOM and keep it up to date.

## Rendering Elements

Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps.

An element describes what you want to see on the screen:

```javascript
const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;
```

Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects, and are cheap to create. React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements.

**Note:**
One might confuse elements with a more widely known concept of “components”. **Elements are what components are “made of”**.

### Rendering an Element into the DOM

Let’s say there is a ```<div>``` somewhere in your HTML file:

```javascript
<div id="root"></div>
```

We call this a “root” DOM node because everything inside it will be managed by React DOM.

Applications built with just React usually have a single root DOM node. If you are integrating React into an existing app, you may have as many isolated root DOM nodes as you like.

To render a React element into a root DOM node, pass both to ```ReactDOM.render()```:

```javascript
const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;
ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
```

React elements are **immutable**. Once you create an element, you can’t change its children or attributes. An element is like a single frame in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain point in time.

With our knowledge so far, the only way to update the UI is to create a new element, and pass it to ```ReactDOM.render()```.

Consider this ticking clock example:

```javascript
function tick() {
  const element = (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <h2>It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
    </div>
  );
  ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
}

setInterval(tick, 1000);
```

It calls ```ReactDOM.render()``` every second from a ```setInterval()``` callback.

**Note:**
In practice, most React apps only call ```ReactDOM.render()``` once. In the next sections we will learn how such code gets encapsulated into stateful components.

### React Only Updates What’s Necessary

React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.

You can verify this by inspecting the last example with the browser developer tools.

Even though we create an element describing the whole UI tree on every tick, only the text node whose contents have changed gets updated by React DOM.

In our experience, thinking about how the UI should look at any given moment, rather than how to change it over time, eliminates a whole class of bugs.

## Components and Props

Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.

Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

### Function and Class Components

The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function:

```javascript
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

This function is a valid React component because it accepts a single “props” (which stands for properties) object argument with data and returns a React element. We call such components “function components” because they are literally JavaScript functions.

You can also use an ES6 class to define a component:

```javascript
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```

The above two components are equivalent from React’s point of view.

Function and Class components both have some additional features that we will discuss further ahead.

### Rendering a Component

Previously, we only encountered React elements that represent DOM tags:

```javascript
const element = <div />;
```

However, elements can also represent user-defined components:

```javascript
const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />;
```

When React sees an element representing a user-defined component, it passes JSX attributes and children to this component as a single object. We call this object “props”.

For example, this code renders “Hello, Sara” on the page:

```javascript
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />;
ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

#### Let’s recap what happens in this example

1. We call ```ReactDOM.render()``` with the ```<Welcome name="Sara" />``` element.
2. React calls the ```Welcome``` component with ```{name: 'Sara'}``` as the props.
3. Our ```Welcome``` component returns a ```<h1>Hello, Sara</h1>``` element as the result.
4. React DOM efficiently updates the DOM to match ```<h1>Hello, Sara</h1>```.

**Note: Always start component names with a capital letter.**
React treats components starting with lowercase letters as DOM tags. For example, ```<div />``` represents an HTML div tag, but ```<Welcome />``` represents a component and requires ```Welcome``` to be in scope.

### Composing Components

Components can refer to other components in their output. This lets us use the same component abstraction for any level of detail. A button, a form, a dialog, a screen: in React apps, all those are commonly expressed as components.

For example, we can create an ```App``` component that renders ```Welcome``` many times:

```javascript
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Welcome name="Sara" />
      <Welcome name="Cahal" />
      <Welcome name="Edite" />
    </div>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <App />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Typically, new React apps have a single App component at the very top. However, if you integrate React into an existing app, you might start bottom-up with a small component like Button and gradually work your way to the top of the view hierarchy.

### Extracting Components

Don’t be afraid to split components into smaller components.

For example, consider this Comment component:

```javascript
function Comment(props) {
  return (
    <div className="Comment">
      <div className="UserInfo">
        <img className="Avatar"
          src={props.author.avatarUrl}
          alt={props.author.name}
        />
        <div className="UserInfo-name">
          {props.author.name}
        </div>
      </div>
      <div className="Comment-text">
        {props.text}
      </div>
      <div className="Comment-date">
        {formatDate(props.date)}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

It accepts author (an object), text (a string), and date (a date) as props, and describes a comment on a social media website.

This component can be tricky to change because of all the nesting, and it is also hard to reuse individual parts of it. Let’s extract a few components from it.

First, we will extract Avatar:

```javascript
function Avatar(props) {
  return (
    <img className="Avatar"
      src={props.user.avatarUrl}
      alt={props.user.name}
    />
  );
}
```

The Avatar doesn’t need to know that it is being rendered inside a Comment. This is why we have given its prop a more generic name: user rather than author.

We recommend naming props from the component’s own point of view rather than the context in which it is being used.

We can now simplify Comment a tiny bit:

```javascript
function Comment(props) {
  return (
    <div className="Comment">
      <div className="UserInfo">
        <Avatar user={props.author} />
        <div className="UserInfo-name">
          {props.author.name}
        </div>
      </div>
      <div className="Comment-text">
        {props.text}
      </div>
      <div className="Comment-date">
        {formatDate(props.date)}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Next, we will extract a UserInfo component that renders an Avatar next to the user’s name:

```javascript
function UserInfo(props) {
  return (
    <div className="UserInfo">
      <Avatar user={props.user} />
      <div className="UserInfo-name">
        {props.user.name}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This lets us simplify Comment even further:

```javascript
function Comment(props) {
  return (
    <div className="Comment">
      <UserInfo user={props.author} />
      <div className="Comment-text">
        {props.text}
      </div>
      <div className="Comment-date">
        {formatDate(props.date)}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Extracting components might seem like grunt work at first, but having a palette of reusable components pays off in larger apps. A good rule of thumb is that if a part of your UI is used several times (Button, Panel, Avatar), or is complex enough on its own (App, FeedStory, Comment), it is a good candidate to be a reusable component.

### Props are Read-Only

Whether you declare a component as a function or a class, **it must never modify its own props**. Consider this ```sum``` function:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

Such functions are called “pure” because they do not attempt to change their inputs, and always return the same result for the same inputs.

In contrast, this function is impure because it changes its own input:

```javascript
function withdraw(account, amount) {
  account.total -= amount;
}
```

React is pretty flexible but it has a single strict rule:

**All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.**

Of course, application UIs are dynamic and change over time. In the next section, we will introduce a new concept of “state”. State allows React components to change their output over time in response to user actions, network responses, and anything else, without violating this rule.

## State and Lifecycle

Consider the ticking clock example from one of the previous sections. In Rendering Elements, we have only learned one way to update the UI. We call ReactDOM.render() to change the rendered output:

```javascript
function tick() {
  const element = (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <h2>It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
    </div>
  );
  ReactDOM.render(
    element,
    document.getElementById('root')
  );
}

setInterval(tick, 1000);
```

In this section, we will learn how to make the Clock component truly reusable and encapsulated. It will set up its own timer and update itself every second.

We can start by encapsulating how the clock looks:

```javascript
function Clock(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <h2>It is {props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
    </div>
  );
}

function tick() {
  ReactDOM.render(
    <Clock date={new Date()} />,
    document.getElementById('root')
  );
}

setInterval(tick, 1000);
```

However, it misses a crucial requirement: the fact that the Clock sets up a timer and updates the UI every second should be an implementation detail of the Clock.

Ideally we want to write this once and have the Clock update itself:

```javascript
ReactDOM.render(
  <Clock />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

To implement this, we need to add “state” to the Clock component.

State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component.

### Converting a Function to a Class

You can convert a function component like Clock to a class in five steps:

1. Create an ES6 class, with the same name, that extends React.Component.
2. Add a single empty method to it called render().
3. Move the body of the function into the render() method.
4. Replace props with this.props in the render() body.
5. Delete the remaining empty function declaration.

```javascript
class Clock extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

Clock is now defined as a class rather than a function.

The render method will be called each time an update happens, but as long as we render ```<Clock />``` into the same DOM node, only a single instance of the Clock class will be used. This lets us use additional features such as local state and lifecycle methods.

### Adding Local State to a Class

We will move the date from props to state in three steps:

Replace ```this.props.date``` with ```this.state.date``` in the ```render()``` method:

```javascript
class Clock extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

Add a class constructor that assigns the initial ```this.state```:

```javascript
class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {date: new Date()};
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

Note how we pass props to the base constructor:

```javascript
constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  this.state = {date: new Date()};
}
```

Class components should always call the base constructor with props.

Remove the date prop from the ```<Clock />``` element:

```javascript
ReactDOM.render(
  <Clock />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

We will later add the timer code back to the component itself.

The result looks like this:

```javascript
class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {date: new Date()};
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Clock />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Next, we’ll make the Clock set up its own timer and update itself every second.

### Adding Lifecycle Methods to a Class

In applications with many components, it’s very important to free up resources taken by the components when they are destroyed.

We want to set up a timer whenever the Clock is rendered to the DOM for the first time. This is called “mounting” in React.

We also want to clear that timer whenever the DOM produced by the Clock is removed. This is called “unmounting” in React.

We can declare special methods on the component class to run some code when a component mounts and unmounts:

```javascript
class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {date: new Date()};
  }

  componentDidMount() {
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

These methods are called “lifecycle methods”.

The ```componentDidMount()``` method runs after the component output has been rendered to the DOM. This is a good place to set up a timer:

```javascript
  componentDidMount() {
    this.timerID = setInterval(
      () => this.tick(),
      1000
    );
  }
```

Note how we save the timer ID right on ```this (this.timerID)```.

While ```this.props``` is set up by React itself and ```this.state``` has a special meaning, you are free to add additional fields to the class manually if you need to store something that doesn’t participate in the data flow (like a timer ID).

We will tear down the timer in the ```componentWillUnmount()``` lifecycle method:

```javascript
  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.timerID);
  }
```

Finally, we will implement a method called ```tick()``` that the Clock component will run every second.

It will use ```this.setState()``` to schedule updates to the component local state:

```javascript
class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {date: new Date()};
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.timerID = setInterval(
      () => this.tick(),
      1000
    );
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.timerID);
  }

  tick() {
    this.setState({
      date: new Date()
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Clock />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Now the clock ticks every second.

Let’s quickly recap what’s going on and the order in which the methods are called:

1. When ```<Clock />``` is passed to ```ReactDOM.render()```, React calls the constructor of the ```Clock``` component. Since ```Clock``` needs to display the current time, it initializes ```this.state``` with an object including the current time. We will later update this state.
2. React then calls the ```Clock``` component’s ```render()``` method. This is how React learns what should be displayed on the screen. React then updates the DOM to match the Clock’s render output.
3. When the ```Clock``` output is inserted in the DOM, React calls the ```componentDidMount()``` lifecycle method. Inside it, the ```Clock``` component asks the browser to set up a timer to call the component’s ```tick()``` method once a second.
4. Every second the browser calls the ```tick()``` method. Inside it, the Clock component schedules a UI update by calling ```setState()``` with an object containing the current time. Thanks to the ```setState()``` call, React knows the state has changed, and calls the ```render()``` method again to learn what should be on the screen. This time, ```this.state.date``` in the ```render()``` method will be different, and so the render output will include the updated time. React updates the DOM accordingly.
5. If the ```Clock``` component is ever removed from the DOM, React calls the ```componentWillUnmount()``` lifecycle method so the timer is stopped.

### Using State Correctly

There are three things you should know about ```setState()```.

#### Do Not Modify State Directly

For example, this will not re-render a component:

```javascript
// Wrong
this.state.comment = 'Hello';
```

Instead, use setState():

```javascript
// Correct
this.setState({comment: 'Hello'});
```

The only place where you can assign this.state is the constructor.

#### State Updates May Be Asynchronous

React may batch multiple ```setState()``` calls into a single update for performance.

Because ```this.props``` and ```this.state``` may be updated asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state.

For example, this code may fail to update the counter:

```javascript
// Wrong
this.setState({
  counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment,
});
```

To fix it, use a second form of ```setState()``` that accepts a function rather than an object. That function will receive the previous state as the first argument, and the props at the time the update is applied as the second argument:

```javascript
// Correct
this.setState((state, props) => ({
  counter: state.counter + props.increment
}));
```

We used an arrow function above, but it also works with regular functions:

```javascript
// Correct
this.setState(function(state, props) {
  return {
    counter: state.counter + props.increment
  };
});
```

#### State Updates are Merged

When you call ```setState()```, React merges the object you provide into the current state.

For example, your state may contain several independent variables:

```javascript
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      posts: [],
      comments: []
    };
  }
```

Then you can update them independently with separate ```setState()``` calls:

```javascript
  componentDidMount() {
    fetchPosts().then(response => {
      this.setState({
        posts: response.posts
      });
    });

    fetchComments().then(response => {
      this.setState({
        comments: response.comments
      });
    });
  }
```

The merging is shallow, so ```this.setState({comments})``` leaves ```this.state.posts``` intact, but completely replaces ```this.state.comments```.

#### The Data Flows Down

Neither parent nor child components can know if a certain component is stateful or stateless, and they shouldn’t care whether it is defined as a function or a class.

This is why state is often called local or encapsulated. It is not accessible to any component other than the one that owns and sets it.

A component may choose to pass its state down as props to its child components:

```javascript
<h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
```

This also works for user-defined components:

```javascript
<FormattedDate date={this.state.date} />
```

The FormattedDate component would receive the date in its props and wouldn’t know whether it came from the ```Clock```’s state, from the ```Clock```’s props, or was typed by hand:

```javascript
function FormattedDate(props) {
  return <h2>It is {props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>;
}
```

This is commonly called a “top-down” or “unidirectional” data flow. Any state is always owned by some specific component, and any data or UI derived from that state can only affect components “below” them in the tree.

If you imagine a component tree as a waterfall of props, each component’s state is like an additional water source that joins it at an arbitrary point but also flows down.

To show that all components are truly isolated, we can create an App component that renders three ```<Clock>```s:

```javascript
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Clock />
      <Clock />
      <Clock />
    </div>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <App />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Each Clock sets up its own timer and updates independently.

In React apps, whether a component is stateful or stateless is considered an implementation detail of the component that may change over time. You can use stateless components inside stateful components, and vice versa.

## Handling Events

Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntax differences:

React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.
For example, the HTML:

```javascript
<button onclick="activateLasers()">
  Activate Lasers
</button>
```

is slightly different in React:

```javascript
<button onClick={activateLasers}>
  Activate Lasers
</button>
```

Another difference is that you cannot return false to prevent default behavior in React. You must call preventDefault explicitly. For example, with plain HTML, to prevent the default link behavior of opening a new page, you can write:

```javascript
<a href="#" onclick="console.log('The link was clicked.'); return false">
  Click me
</a>
```

In React, this could instead be:

```javascript
function ActionLink() {
  function handleClick(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log('The link was clicked.');
  }

  return (
    <a href="#" onClick={handleClick}>
      Click me
    </a>
  );
}
```

Here, e is a synthetic event. React defines these synthetic events according to the W3C spec, so you don’t need to worry about cross-browser compatibility. See the SyntheticEvent reference guide to learn more.

When using React, you generally don’t need to call addEventListener to add listeners to a DOM element after it is created. Instead, just provide a listener when the element is initially rendered.

When you define a component using an ES6 class, a common pattern is for an event handler to be a method on the class. For example, this Toggle component renders a button that lets the user toggle between “ON” and “OFF” states:

```javascript
class Toggle extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {isToggleOn: true};

    // This binding is necessary to make `this` work in the callback
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
  }

  handleClick() {
    this.setState(state => ({
      isToggleOn: !state.isToggleOn
    }));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick={this.handleClick}>
        {this.state.isToggleOn ? 'ON' : 'OFF'}
      </button>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Toggle />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

You have to be careful about the meaning of this in JSX callbacks. In JavaScript, class methods are not bound by default. If you forget to bind this.handleClick and pass it to onClick, this will be undefined when the function is actually called.

This is not React-specific behavior; it is a part of how functions work in JavaScript. Generally, if you refer to a method without () after it, such as onClick={this.handleClick}, you should bind that method.

If calling bind annoys you, there are two ways you can get around this. If you are using the experimental public class fields syntax, you can use class fields to correctly bind callbacks:

```javascript
class LoggingButton extends React.Component {
  // This syntax ensures `this` is bound within handleClick.
  // Warning: this is *experimental* syntax.
  handleClick = () => {
    console.log('this is:', this);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick={this.handleClick}>
        Click me
      </button>
    );
  }
}
```

This syntax is enabled by default in Create React App.

If you aren’t using class fields syntax, you can use an arrow function in the callback:

```javascript
class LoggingButton extends React.Component {
  handleClick() {
    console.log('this is:', this);
  }

  render() {
    // This syntax ensures `this` is bound within handleClick
    return (
      <button onClick={() => this.handleClick()}>
        Click me
      </button>
    );
  }
}
```

The problem with this syntax is that a different callback is created each time the LoggingButton renders. In most cases, this is fine. However, if this callback is passed as a prop to lower components, those components might do an extra re-rendering. We generally recommend binding in the constructor or using the class fields syntax, to avoid this sort of performance problem.

### Passing Arguments to Event Handlers

Inside a loop, it is common to want to pass an extra parameter to an event handler. For example, if id is the row ID, either of the following would work:

```javascript
<button onClick={(e) => this.deleteRow(id, e)}>Delete Row</button>
<button onClick={this.deleteRow.bind(this, id)}>Delete Row</button>
```

The above two lines are equivalent, and use arrow functions and Function.prototype.bind respectively.

In both cases, the e argument representing the React event will be passed as a second argument after the ID. With an arrow function, we have to pass it explicitly, but with bind any further arguments are automatically forwarded.

## Conditional Rendering

In React, you can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need. Then, you can render only some of them, depending on the state of your application.

Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript. Use JavaScript operators like if or the conditional operator to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.

Consider these two components:

```javascript
function UserGreeting(props) {
  return <h1>Welcome back!</h1>;
}

function GuestGreeting(props) {
  return <h1>Please sign up.</h1>;
}
```

We’ll create a Greeting component that displays either of these components depending on whether a user is logged in:

```javascript
function Greeting(props) {
  const isLoggedIn = props.isLoggedIn;
  if (isLoggedIn) {
    return <UserGreeting />;
  }
  return <GuestGreeting />;
}

ReactDOM.render(
  // Try changing to isLoggedIn={true}:
  <Greeting isLoggedIn={false} />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

This example renders a different greeting depending on the value of isLoggedIn prop.

### Element Variables

You can use variables to store elements. This can help you conditionally render a part of the component while the rest of the output doesn’t change.

Consider these two new components representing Logout and Login buttons:

```javascript
function LoginButton(props) {
  return (
    <button onClick={props.onClick}>
      Login
    </button>
  );
}

function LogoutButton(props) {
  return (
    <button onClick={props.onClick}>
      Logout
    </button>
  );
}
```

In the example below, we will create a stateful component called LoginControl.

It will render either ```<LoginButton />``` or ```<LogoutButton />``` depending on its current state. It will also render a ```<Greeting />``` from the previous example:

```javascript
class LoginControl extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleLoginClick = this.handleLoginClick.bind(this);
    this.handleLogoutClick = this.handleLogoutClick.bind(this);
    this.state = {isLoggedIn: false};
  }

  handleLoginClick() {
    this.setState({isLoggedIn: true});
  }

  handleLogoutClick() {
    this.setState({isLoggedIn: false});
  }

  render() {
    const isLoggedIn = this.state.isLoggedIn;
    let button;
    if (isLoggedIn) {
      button = <LogoutButton onClick={this.handleLogoutClick} />;
    } else {
      button = <LoginButton onClick={this.handleLoginClick} />;
    }

    return (
      <div>
        <Greeting isLoggedIn={isLoggedIn} />
        {button}
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <LoginControl />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

While declaring a variable and using an if statement is a fine way to conditionally render a component, sometimes you might want to use a shorter syntax. There are a few ways to inline conditions in JSX, explained below.

### Inline If with Logical && Operator

You may embed any expressions in JSX by wrapping them in curly braces. This includes the JavaScript logical && operator. It can be handy for conditionally including an element:

```javascript
function Mailbox(props) {
  const unreadMessages = props.unreadMessages;
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello!</h1>
      {unreadMessages.length > 0 &&
        <h2>
          You have {unreadMessages.length} unread messages.
        </h2>
      }
    </div>
  );
}

const messages = ['React', 'Re: React', 'Re:Re: React'];
ReactDOM.render(
  <Mailbox unreadMessages={messages} />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

It works because in JavaScript, true && expression always evaluates to expression, and false && expression always evaluates to false.

Therefore, if the condition is true, the element right after && will appear in the output. If it is false, React will ignore and skip it.

### Inline If-Else with Conditional Operator

Another method for conditionally rendering elements inline is to use the JavaScript conditional operator ```condition ? true : false```.

In the example below, we use it to conditionally render a small block of text.

```javascript
render() {
  const isLoggedIn = this.state.isLoggedIn;
  return (
    <div>
      The user is <b>{isLoggedIn ? 'currently' : 'not'}</b> logged in.
    </div>
  );
}
It can also be used for larger expressions although it is less obvious what’s going on:

render() {
  const isLoggedIn = this.state.isLoggedIn;
  return (
    <div>
      {isLoggedIn
        ? <LogoutButton onClick={this.handleLogoutClick} />
        : <LoginButton onClick={this.handleLoginClick} />
      }
    </div>
  );
}
```

Just like in JavaScript, it is up to you to choose an appropriate style based on what you and your team consider more readable. Also remember that whenever conditions become too complex, it might be a good time to extract a component.

### Preventing Component from Rendering

In rare cases you might want a component to hide itself even though it was rendered by another component. To do this return null instead of its render output.

In the example below, the ```<WarningBanner />``` is rendered depending on the value of the prop called warn. If the value of the prop is false, then the component does not render:

```javascript
function WarningBanner(props) {
  if (!props.warn) {
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <div className="warning">
      Warning!
    </div>
  );
}

class Page extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {showWarning: true};
    this.handleToggleClick = this.handleToggleClick.bind(this);
  }

  handleToggleClick() {
    this.setState(state => ({
      showWarning: !state.showWarning
    }));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <WarningBanner warn={this.state.showWarning} />
        <button onClick={this.handleToggleClick}>
          {this.state.showWarning ? 'Hide' : 'Show'}
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Page />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Returning null from a component’s render method does not affect the firing of the component’s lifecycle methods. For instance componentDidUpdate will still be called.

## Lists and Keys

First, let’s review how you transform lists in JavaScript.

Given the code below, we use the ```map()``` function to take an array of numbers and double their values. We assign the new array returned by ```map()``` to the variable doubled and log it:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = numbers.map((number) => number * 2);
console.log(doubled);
```

This code logs ```[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]``` to the console.

In React, transforming arrays into lists of elements is nearly identical.

### Rendering Multiple Components

You can build collections of elements and include them in JSX using curly braces {}.

Below, we loop through the numbers array using the JavaScript map() function. We return a <li> element for each item. Finally, we assign the resulting array of elements to listItems:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
  <li>{number}</li>
);
```

We include the entire listItems array inside a ```<ul>``` element, and render it to the DOM:

```javascript
ReactDOM.render(
  <ul>{listItems}</ul>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

This code displays a bullet list of numbers between 1 and 5.

### Basic List Component

Usually you would render lists inside a component.

We can refactor the previous example into a component that accepts an array of numbers and outputs a list of elements.

```javascript
function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
    <li>{number}</li>
  );
  return (
    <ul>{listItems}</ul>
  );
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
ReactDOM.render(
  <NumberList numbers={numbers} />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

When you run this code, you’ll be given a warning that a key should be provided for list items. A “key” is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements. We’ll discuss why it’s important in the next section.

Let’s assign a key to our list items inside numbers.map() and fix the missing key issue.

```javascript
function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
    <li key={number.toString()}>
      {number}
    </li>
  );
  return (
    <ul>{listItems}</ul>
  );
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
ReactDOM.render(
  <NumberList numbers={numbers} />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

### Keys

Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
  <li key={number.toString()}>
    {number}
  </li>
);
```

The best way to pick a key is to use a string that uniquely identifies a list item among its siblings. Most often you would use IDs from your data as keys:

```javascript
const todoItems = todos.map((todo) =>
  <li key={todo.id}>
    {todo.text}
  </li>
);
```

When you don’t have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item index as a key as a last resort:

```javascript
const todoItems = todos.map((todo, index) =>
  // Only do this if items have no stable IDs
  <li key={index}>
    {todo.text}
  </li>
);
```

We don’t recommend using indexes for keys if the order of items may change. This can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state. Check out Robin Pokorny’s article for an in-depth explanation on the negative impacts of using an index as a key. If you choose not to assign an explicit key to list items then React will default to using indexes as keys.

Here is an in-depth explanation about why keys are necessary if you’re interested in learning more.

### Extracting Components with Keys

Keys only make sense in the context of the surrounding array.

For example, if you extract a ListItem component, you should keep the key on the ```<ListItem />``` elements in the array rather than on the ```<li>``` element in the ListItem itself.

Example: Incorrect Key Usage

```javascript
function ListItem(props) {
  const value = props.value;
  return (
    // Wrong! There is no need to specify the key here:
    <li key={value.toString()}>
      {value}
    </li>
  );
}

function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
    // Wrong! The key should have been specified here:
    <ListItem value={number} />
  );
  return (
    <ul>
      {listItems}
    </ul>
  );
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
ReactDOM.render(
  <NumberList numbers={numbers} />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Example: Correct Key Usage

```javascript
function ListItem(props) {
  // Correct! There is no need to specify the key here:
  return <li>{props.value}</li>;
}

function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
    // Correct! Key should be specified inside the array.
    <ListItem key={number.toString()} value={number} />
  );
  return (
    <ul>
      {listItems}
    </ul>
  );
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
ReactDOM.render(
  <NumberList numbers={numbers} />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

A good rule of thumb is that elements inside the ```map()``` call need keys.

### Keys Must Only Be Unique Among Siblings

Keys used within arrays should be unique among their siblings. However they don’t need to be globally unique. We can use the same keys when we produce two different arrays:

```javascript
function Blog(props) {
  const sidebar = (
    <ul>
      {props.posts.map((post) =>
        <li key={post.id}>
          {post.title}
        </li>
      )}
    </ul>
  );
  const content = props.posts.map((post) =>
    <div key={post.id}>
      <h3>{post.title}</h3>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
    </div>
  );
  return (
    <div>
      {sidebar}
      <hr />
      {content}
    </div>
  );
}

const posts = [
  {id: 1, title: 'Hello World', content: 'Welcome to learning React!'},
  {id: 2, title: 'Installation', content: 'You can install React from npm.'}
];
ReactDOM.render(
  <Blog posts={posts} />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Keys serve as a hint to React but they don’t get passed to your components. If you need the same value in your component, pass it explicitly as a prop with a different name:

```javascript
const content = posts.map((post) =>
  <Post
    key={post.id}
    id={post.id}
    title={post.title} />
);
```

With the example above, the Post component can read props.id, but not props.key.

### Embedding map() in JSX

In the examples above we declared a separate listItems variable and included it in JSX:

```javascript
function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
    <ListItem key={number.toString()}
              value={number} />
  );
  return (
    <ul>
      {listItems}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

JSX allows embedding any expression in curly braces so we could inline the ```map()``` result:

```javascript
function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  return (
    <ul>
      {numbers.map((number) =>
        <ListItem key={number.toString()}
                  value={number} />
      )}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

Sometimes this results in clearer code, but this style can also be abused. Like in JavaScript, it is up to you to decide whether it is worth extracting a variable for readability. Keep in mind that if the ```map()``` body is too nested, it might be a good time to extract a component.

## Forms

HTML form elements work a little bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state. For example, this form in plain HTML accepts a single name:

```javascript
<form>
  <label>
    Name:
    <input type="text" name="name" />
  </label>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
```

This form has the default HTML form behavior of browsing to a new page when the user submits the form. If you want this behavior in React, it just works. But in most cases, it’s convenient to have a JavaScript function that handles the submission of the form and has access to the data that the user entered into the form. The standard way to achieve this is with a technique called “controlled components”.

### Controlled Components

In HTML, form elements such as ```<input>```, ```<textarea>```, and ```<select>``` typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with ```setState()```.

We can combine the two by making the React state be the “single source of truth”. Then the React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a “controlled component”.

For example, if we want to make the previous example log the name when it is submitted, we can write the form as a controlled component:

```javascript
class NameForm extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {value: ''};

    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
  }

  handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({value: event.target.value});
  }

  handleSubmit(event) {
    alert('A name was submitted: ' + this.state.value);
    event.preventDefault();
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <label>
          Name:
          <input type="text" value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChange} />
        </label>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

Since the ```value``` attribute is set on our form element, the displayed value will always be ```this.state.value```, making the React state the source of truth. Since ```handleChange``` runs on every keystroke to update the React state, the displayed value will update as the user types.

With a controlled component, the input’s value is always driven by the React state. While this means you have to type a bit more code, you can now pass the value to other UI elements too, or reset it from other event handlers.

### The textarea Tag

In HTML, a ```<textarea>``` element defines its text by its children:

```javascript
<textarea>
  Hello there, this is some text in a text area
</textarea>
```

In React, a ```<textarea>``` uses a ```value``` attribute instead. This way, a form using a ```<textarea>``` can be written very similarly to a form that uses a single-line input:

```javascript
class EssayForm extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      value: 'Please write an essay about your favorite DOM element.'
    };

    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
  }

  handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({value: event.target.value});
  }

  handleSubmit(event) {
    alert('An essay was submitted: ' + this.state.value);
    event.preventDefault();
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <label>
          Essay:
          <textarea value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChange} />
        </label>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

Notice that ```this.state.value``` is initialized in the constructor, so that the text area starts off with some text in it.

### The select Tag

In HTML, ```<select>``` creates a drop-down list. For example, this HTML creates a drop-down list of flavors:

```javascript
<select>
  <option value="grapefruit">Grapefruit</option>
  <option value="lime">Lime</option>
  <option selected value="coconut">Coconut</option>
  <option value="mango">Mango</option>
</select>
```

Note that the Coconut option is initially selected, because of the selected attribute. React, instead of using this selected attribute, uses a value attribute on the root select tag. This is more convenient in a controlled component because you only need to update it in one place. For example:

```javascript
class FlavorForm extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {value: 'coconut'};

    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
  }

  handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({value: event.target.value});
  }

  handleSubmit(event) {
    alert('Your favorite flavor is: ' + this.state.value);
    event.preventDefault();
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <label>
          Pick your favorite flavor:
          <select value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChange}>
            <option value="grapefruit">Grapefruit</option>
            <option value="lime">Lime</option>
            <option value="coconut">Coconut</option>
            <option value="mango">Mango</option>
          </select>
        </label>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

Overall, this makes it so that ```<input type="text">```, ```<textarea>```, and ```<select>``` all work very similarly - they all accept a value attribute that you can use to implement a controlled component.

#### Note

You can pass an array into the value attribute, allowing you to select multiple options in a select tag:

```javascript
<select multiple={true} value={['B', 'C']}>
```

### The file input Tag

In HTML, an ```<input type="file">``` lets the user choose one or more files from their device storage to be uploaded to a server or manipulated by JavaScript via the File API.

```javascript
<input type="file" />
```

Because its value is read-only, it is an uncontrolled component in React. It is discussed together with other uncontrolled components later in the documentation.

### Handling Multiple Inputs

When you need to handle multiple controlled input elements, you can add a name attribute to each element and let the handler function choose what to do based on the value of event.target.name.

For example:

```javascript
class Reservation extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      isGoing: true,
      numberOfGuests: 2
    };

    this.handleInputChange = this.handleInputChange.bind(this);
  }

  handleInputChange(event) {
    const target = event.target;
    const value = target.name === 'isGoing' ? target.checked : target.value;
    const name = target.name;

    this.setState({
      [name]: value
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <form>
        <label>
          Is going:
          <input
            name="isGoing"
            type="checkbox"
            checked={this.state.isGoing}
            onChange={this.handleInputChange} />
        </label>
        <br />
        <label>
          Number of guests:
          <input
            name="numberOfGuests"
            type="number"
            value={this.state.numberOfGuests}
            onChange={this.handleInputChange} />
        </label>
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

Note how we used the ES6 computed property name syntax to update the state key corresponding to the given input name:

```javascript
this.setState({
  [name]: value
});
```

It is equivalent to this ES5 code:

```javascript
var partialState = {};
partialState[name] = value;
this.setState(partialState);
```

Also, since ```setState()``` automatically merges a partial state into the current state, we only needed to call it with the changed parts.

### Controlled Input Null Value

Specifying the value prop on a controlled component prevents the user from changing the input unless you desire so. If you’ve specified a value but the input is still editable, you may have accidentally set value to undefined or null.

The following code demonstrates this. (The input is locked at first but becomes editable after a short delay.)

```javascript
ReactDOM.render(<input value="hi" />, mountNode);

setTimeout(function() {
  ReactDOM.render(<input value={null} />, mountNode);
}, 1000);
```

### Alternatives to Controlled Components

It can sometimes be tedious to use controlled components, because you need to write an event handler for every way your data can change and pipe all of the input state through a React component. This can become particularly annoying when you are converting a preexisting codebase to React, or integrating a React application with a non-React library. In these situations, you might want to check out uncontrolled components, an alternative technique for implementing input forms.

### Fully-Fledged Solutions

If you’re looking for a complete solution including validation, keeping track of the visited fields, and handling form submission, Formik is one of the popular choices. However, it is built on the same principles of controlled components and managing state — so don’t neglect to learn them.
