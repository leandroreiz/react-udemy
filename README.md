## Using JSX

Consider this variable declaration:

```javascript
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

This funny tag syntax is neither a string nor HTML.

It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.

JSX produces React “elements”. We will explore rendering them to the DOM in the next section. Below, you can find the basics of JSX necessary to get you started.

### Embedding Expressions in JSX

In the example below, we declare a variable called name and then use it inside JSX by wrapping it in curly braces:

```javascript
const name = 'Josh Perez';
const element = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;

ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

You can put any valid JavaScript expression inside the curly braces in JSX. For example, ```2 + 2```, ```user.firstName```, or ```formatName(user)``` are all valid JavaScript expressions.

In the example below, we embed the result of calling a JavaScript function, ```formatName(user)```, into an ```<h1>``` element.

```javascript
function formatName(user) {
  return user.firstName + ' ' + user.lastName;
}

const user = {
  firstName: 'Harper',
  lastName: 'Perez'
};

const element = (
  <h1>
    Hello, {formatName(user)}!
  </h1>
);

ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

### JSX is an Expression Too

After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects.

This means that you can use JSX inside of if statements and for loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return it from functions:

```javascript
function getGreeting(user) {
  if (user) {
    return <h1>Hello, {formatName(user)}!</h1>;
  }
  return <h1>Hello, Stranger.</h1>;
}
```

### JSX Represents Objects

Babel compiles JSX down to ```React.createElement()``` calls.

These two examples are identical:

```javascript
const element = (
  <h1 className="greeting">
    Hello, world!
  </h1>
);
const element = React.createElement(
  'h1',
  {className: 'greeting'},
  'Hello, world!'
);
```

```React.createElement()``` performs a few checks to help you write bug-free code but essentially it creates an object like this:

```javascript
// Note: this structure is simplified
const element = {
  type: 'h1',
  props: {
    className: 'greeting',
    children: 'Hello, world!'
  }
};
```

These objects are called “React elements”. You can think of them as descriptions of what you want to see on the screen. React reads these objects and uses them to construct the DOM and keep it up to date.
